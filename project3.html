        <h1>Preemptive planning and Dynamic obstacle avoidance with SGANs and MPC</h1>
        <p>Robot motion planning in dynamic environments is a very challenging problem that requires the​
            robot to generate safe and efficient paths to follow. Where the safety of pedestrians or humans is​
            associated with robot collisions, the factor of the robot’s efficiency plays a pivotal role in minimizing​
            pause time, path navigation, and utilization of resources such as batteries.​
            Keeping these parameters into consideration, and the example of the Starship food delivery robots,​
            which tends to halt if people come in front of it, we have solved this problem by integrating SGANs​
            (Social Generative Adversarial Networks) for human movement predictions and obstacle modeling,​
            traditional motion planning algorithms and approaches such as RRT*/modified RRT* paired with​
            spline interpolation, and motion control using Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to​
            dynamically avoid obstacles and reach the target location.​
            Our approach and experimental results indicate that the chance of collision drastically drops to​
            approximately 70% in an environment with up to 6 people.​

        <p> For the baseline, we utilized Social GAN: Socially Acceptable Trajectories with Generative Adversar-​
            ial Networks by Agrim Gupta et al. [1], which assists to predict the motion behavior of pedestrians.​
            The paper uses GANs to overcome the difficulties in approximating intractable probabilistic compu-​
            tation and behavioral inference. The proposed GAN in the SGAN paper is an RNN Encoder-Decoder​
            generator and an RNN-based encoder discriminator with a variety loss to encourage the GAN’s​
            generative network to spread its distribution and cover the space of possible paths while remaining​
            consistent with the observed inputs and a new pooling mechanism which learns a "global" pooling​
            vector that encodes subtle cues for all participants in a scene. This model uses accuracy, speed, and​
            the ability of the model as metrics to generate a variety of socially acceptable trajectories based on​
            experiments on several publicly available real-world crowd datasets​                    </p>
