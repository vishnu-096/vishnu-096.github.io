                <p>Vishnu is an International Graduate student at ASU majoring in Robotics And Autonomous Systems. He has a strong background in robotics and embedded systems.
                    Vishnu has an experience of over two years at Marvell Technology where he worked on designing and developing data plane modules for switches and routers. His strong drive and interest in the field of robotics motivated him to switch from the computer networks/embedded domain to robotics.
                    After which, he has worked on multiple research projects mainly in the field of autonomous mobile robot.</p>
                    <p> He has worked with robotic manipulators, social robot and legged robots in different projects and have a great practical as well as conceptual understanding. He has filed a patent for a device that helps visually challenged people for navigation and has published papers  at multiple conferences. He enjoys taking part in Hackathons and strives to be the best in whatever he does. Any new problem or application in robotics interests him and  main area expertise in control theory, computer vision and autonomous robots.
                    Being an avid soccer fan, he spends his spare time playing/watching soccer. He also enjoys hiking and traveling.
